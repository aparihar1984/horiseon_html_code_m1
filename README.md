# horiseon_html_code_m1
Module 1 Challenge Involving Code Refactoring of Horiseon Webpage:

For Assignment 1, we were given the task of making sure our Horiseon webpage met accessibility standards.  
To accomplish this, I completed the following steps:

I created my horiseon_html_code_m1 repository on GitHub which features all refactored and commented coding as well as this README.md document.

I cloned my repository and the starter code from the "https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/urban-octo-telegram" repository that was given in the assignment.  The starter code can be found on the feature/starter-code branch of my horiseon_html_code-m1 repository.

I added semantic HTML elements such as <section>, <article>, <nav>, and <link> to the index.html document.

I kept the structure of the index.html document the same but refactored the code in the style.css document in order to follow a logical structure.

I added accessible alt attributes to the images in order to provide descriptive alt text for users who rely on screen readers.

I ensured the heading attributes were listed in a logical and sequential order.

I changed the title element into a concise, descriptive title to create a strong first impression and improve search engine recognition.
